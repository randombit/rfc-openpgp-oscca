# Encoding of Public and Private Keys

The following algorithm-specific packets are added to Section 5.5.2
of [@RFC4880], "Public-Key Packet Formats", to support SM2DSA and
SM2PKE.

This algorithm-specific portion is:

Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2DSA keys:

* a variable-length field containing a curve OID, formatted
  as follows:

 - a one-octet size of the following field; values 0 and
      0xFF are reserved for future extensions
 - octets representing a curve OID, defined in (#sm2-curve)

*  MPI of an EC point representing a public key

Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2PKE keys:

* a variable-length field containing a curve OID, formatted
  as follows:

 - a one-octet size of the following field; values 0 and
      0xFF are reserved for future extensions
 - octets representing a curve OID, defined in (#sm2-curve)

*  MPI of an EC point representing a public key

<!--- MPI of RSA public encryption exponent e.-->

* a variable-length field containing KDF parameters, formatted as
  follows:

 - a one-octet size of the following fields; values 0 and 0xff are
   reserved for future extensions

 - a one-octet value 01, reserved for future extensions

 - a one-octet hash function ID used with a KDF

<!--
  - a one-octet algorithm ID for the symmetric algorithm used to wrap
    the symmetric key used for the message encryption; see Section 8 for
    details
-->

An SM2PKE public key is composed of the same sequence of fields that
define an SM2DSA key, plus the KDF parameters field.

The following algorithm-specific packets are added to Section 5.5.3.
of [@RFC4880], "Secret-Key Packet Formats", to support SM2DSA and
SM2PKE.

Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2DSA or SM2PKE secret keys:

*  an MPI of an integer representing the secret key, which is a
   scalar of the public EC point
