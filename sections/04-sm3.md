# SM3 Hash Algorithm {#sm3-algorithm}

The SM3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm [@!GBT.32905-2016] is an iterative hash
function designed by Xiaoyun Wang et al., published by [@OSCCA] as an
alternative to SHA-2 [@NIST.FIPS.180-4].

It was first published by the OSCCA in public in 2010 [@SM3], then received
the designation [@GMT-0004-2012] in 2012, and published as a Chinese national
standard (GB standard) as [@!GBT.32905-2016].

The algorithm is designed to be used for commercial cryptographic applications
including, but not limited to:

* digital signatures and their verification
* message authentication code generation and their verification
* generation of random numbers

According to the authors, SM3 is designed with a Merkle-Damgard construction
and is very similar to SHA-2 [@NIST.FIPS.180-4] of the MD4 [@RFC6150] family,
with the addition of several strengthening features such as a more complex
step function and stronger message dependency than SHA-256
[@SM3-Boomerang].

SM3 produces an output hash value of 256 bits long, based on 512-bit
input message blocks [@SM3-Boomerang], on input lengths up to $$2^(m)$$.

The specification of SM3 is described in [@!GBT.32905-2016], [@SM3] and
[@I-D.shen-sm3-hash].
