# SM4 Symmetric Encryption Algorithm {#sm4-algorithm}

SM4 [@SM4] is a symmetric encryption algorithm designed by Shuwang Lu et
al. in 2006 as SMS4, and officially published published by the OSCCA in
2012 as SM4.

The algorithm is publicly described in
"GM/T 0002-2012 SM4 Block Cipher Algorithm Standard" [@!SM4],
and is used in WAPI (Wired Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure),
the Chinese National Standard for Wireless LAN [@GB15629.11-2003].

SM4 is a 128-bit block cipher, uses a key size of 128 bits and
internally uses an 8-bit S-box.
It performs 32 rounds per block, and decryption simply reverses the
order of encryption.
